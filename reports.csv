",0,"None, survival bias was not explicitly controlled for in this study",1,"The study found that municipalities with higher World War I casualties experienced a significant increase in socialist vote shares in the 1919 election. This increase in socialist support was linked to the subsequent rise of fascism, as municipalities with higher socialist vote shares in 1919 also saw greater fascist activity and higher vote shares for the Fascist Party in the 1921 and 1924 elections. The findings suggest that the perceived threat of socialism played a critical role in the rise of fascism, with local elites and middle-class Italians supporting the fascists to counter the socialist threat. The study also found that early fascist activity was associated with a greater likelihood of Jewish deportations during World War II and lower vote shares for Christian Democrats after World War II, indicating long-term attitudinal impacts. The study examined the long-term effects of early fascist activity on post-war political attitudes, finding that areas with greater early fascist activity had lower vote shares for Christian Democrats and higher vote shares for center-left and other left-wing parties in post-war elections. This suggests that the collaboration with fascists during the interwar period led to a lasting delegitimization of the center-right political establishment.","The study found significant behavioral outcomes linked to the rise of fascism. Municipalities that experienced higher socialist support following World War I saw increased fascist activity, measured by the presence of local Fascist Party branches, incidents of fascist violence, and higher vote shares for the Fascist Party in subsequent elections. Specifically, municipalities with greater socialist support in 1919 had higher rates of fascist violence between 1920 and 1922, including attacks on socialist and other opposition groups. This violence was instrumental in consolidating fascist power and disrupting socialist organizations. Additionally, municipalities with early fascist activity were more likely to collaborate with Nazi authorities during World War II, leading to higher rates of Jewish deportations. This behavioral shift towards fascist support and collaboration had lasting impacts on political behavior, as these municipalities showed lower support for center-right parties and higher support for left-wing parties in post-war elections, reflecting the long-term influence of early fascist mobilization on local political dynamics.",1,"The analysis revealed significant differences in the rise of fascism based on the level of socialist support and the presence of local elites and landowner associations.

However, the study acknowledges that survival bias cannot be fully eliminated, as individuals who survived the conflict may differ systematically from those who did not. To mitigate this, the study includes robustness checks and sensitivity analyses, ensuring that the observed effects of conflict exposure on political participation are not driven by differences in survival rates. The study's use of district fixed effects and individual-level controls helps to reduce the potential impact of survival bias on the results.",1,"The study finds that exposure to LRA violence is associated with an increase in informal political participation, particularly in terms of political discussion. This suggests that the conflict heightened political awareness and engagement, as individuals in affected districts became more likely to discuss political issues with friends, family, and neighbors. However, the study does not find a significant impact of violence on formal electoral participation, indicating that the increased political engagement did not translate into higher voter turnout. These attitudinal outcomes suggest that while civil war may stimulate political interest and informal engagement, it does not necessarily lead to increased participation in formal political processes such as elections. The findings have important implications for understanding the long-term effects of conflict on political attitudes and the challenges of fostering democratic participation in post-conflict societies.","The study demonstrates that individuals in districts heavily affected by LRA violence were more likely to engage in informal political activities, such as attending community meetings and discussing politics. This behavioral shift reflects a mobilization of the population in response to the conflict, as individuals sought to address local needs and coordinate collective action. However, the study finds no significant impact of violence on electoral turnout, suggesting that the increased political engagement did not extend to formal political participation. The behavioral outcomes indicate that while civil war can enhance civic engagement and local political participation, it may not lead to greater involvement in national electoral processes. This highlights the complex relationship between conflict, civic engagement, and formal political behavior, with important implications for post-conflict reconstruction and governance.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the intensity and timing of conflict exposure. The increase in political discussion and meeting attendance is more pronounced in districts that experienced higher levels of violence, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the conflict. However, the lack of impact on electoral turnout is consistent across different levels of conflict intensity, suggesting that the mobilizing effects of violence are primarily limited to informal political participation. The study also explores the potential moderating role of demographic factors, such as age, gender, and education, finding that the effects of conflict on political participation are generally consistent across different population groups. These heterogeneous effects underscore the importance of considering both the type and timing of political participation when assessing the impact of civil war on political behavior.

The researchers attribute this decline in turnout to a deterrence effect, where the high costs of political participation during Stalin's era have created long-lasting norms of political disengagement.","The study shows that Stalin-era repression has long-term behavioral effects on political participation. In addition to lower voter turnout, the researchers find that historically repressed communities in Russia are more likely to support opposition candidates and less likely to support the incumbent regime. This pattern is consistent across different political contexts, including Ukraine, where similar effects are observed despite a different post-Soviet political environment.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on local socio-economic characteristics and the historical presence of repression. Specifically, localities that experienced higher levels of Stalin-era repression exhibit a more pronounced decline in voter turnout and greater support for opposition candidates. This variation suggests that the intensity of repression differentially impacts political behavior across communities. The analysis reveals that these effects are not confined to specific demographic groups but are widespread across various communities. For example, both urban and rural areas that faced severe repression show similar patterns of reduced political participation. Additionally, the study finds that the long-term impact of repression is mediated by local norms and expectations regarding the costs and risks associated with political participation. In communities where the memory of repression remains strong, the fear and distrust generated by historical political violence continue to deter political engagement. Moreover, the researchers highlight that the effects of repression are influenced by the socio-economic context of each locality. Areas with higher pre-repression levels of economic development and social capital tend to show more resilience against the long-term deterrent effects of political terror. In contrast, less developed regions with weaker social networks exhibit more substantial declines in political participation. The study also considers the role of local leadership and community organization in shaping the heterogeneous effects of repression. In some localities, strong community leaders and active civil society organizations have mitigated the negative impact of past repression by fostering a culture of political engagement and resilience.

Male abductees exhibited significant deficits in education, earnings, and skilled employment compared to non-abducted peers. Females, however, showed little difference in these economic outcomes, primarily because their civilian opportunities were already limited. Abducted females were more likely to be involved in supportive roles within the LRA and less likely to receive education even if they were not abducted. The study also found that males who perpetrated more violence were more likely to report ongoing social and psychological problems. Overall, the findings challenged the notion that ex-combatants are social pariahs, highlighting the resilience and successful reintegration of many female ex-combatants.",1,"The study identifies significant gender differences in the impacts of abduction and war experiences. Females tend to experience greater emotional distress and social challenges compared to males.

The research primarily focuses on Tamil civilians from the Jaffna district, an area that experienced significant violence from both the Sinhalese (outgroup) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Tamil militant group. The study aims to understand how exposure to ingroup violence—violence perpetrated by members of one's own ethnic group—differently affects political and social outcomes compared to outgroup violence. It challenges the traditional view that only outgroup violence strengthens ethnic identity and increases intergroup prejudice by showing that ingroup violence can weaken ethnic identity and reduce intergroup prejudice. The findings have significant implications for post-conflict reconciliation processes, particularly in societies where civil wars involve complex patterns of violence within and between ethnic groups.

The study includes sensitivity tests to assess the impact of survival bias, such as excluding individuals from regions with high casualty rates. While these measures help to mitigate the impact of survival bias, the authors recognize that it cannot be fully eliminated and note it as a potential limitation of the study. The partial control for survival bias ensures that the study's findings are more robust, but the authors caution that the results should be interpreted with this limitation in mind. The study's efforts to address survival bias are thorough, but the inherent challenges of conducting research in post-conflict settings mean that some degree of bias is unavoidable.

These individuals also hold less positive stereotypes toward fellow Tamils and are less prejudiced against Sinhalese. The findings suggest that ingroup violence can undermine ethnic solidarity and promote a more inclusive national identity, contrary to the effects typically associated with outgroup violence. This attitudinal shift has significant implications for post-conflict reconciliation efforts, as it indicates that victims of ingroup violence may be more open to cross-ethnic cooperation and less likely to harbor long-term grievances against outgroup members. The study provides strong evidence that the legacies of ingroup violence differ fundamentally from those of outgroup violence, with important consequences for the stability and cohesion of post-conflict societies. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature that challenges the traditional focus on outgroup violence in studies of civil conflict, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to understanding the long-term impacts of violence in divided societies.","The study shows that Tamil civilians exposed to ingroup violence are less likely to engage in discriminatory behavior against Sinhalese in both altruistic and trust-based exchanges, as measured by dictator and trust games. These individuals are more likely to behave equitably towards outgroup members, suggesting that exposure to ingroup violence reduces ethnic discrimination and fosters prosocial behavior across ethnic lines. Conversely, those who experienced outgroup violence (from Sinhalese forces) are more likely to display discriminatory behavior towards Sinhalese and exhibit stronger ingroup favoritism. The behavioral findings support the study's broader argument that ingroup violence has a unique impact on social relations, reducing ethnic tensions and promoting cross-group cooperation in the post-conflict period. The implications of these findings are significant for post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation efforts, as they suggest that addressing the legacies of ingroup violence could be crucial for building lasting peace and social cohesion in divided societies. The study's use of behavioral experiments provides robust evidence for these claims, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms through which violence shapes long-term social and political outcomes.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the intensity of exposure to violence and the identity of the perpetrators. Tamil civilians who experienced high levels of ingroup violence were more likely to reject their ethnic identity and embrace a broader national identity, while those who experienced moderate levels of ingroup violence showed more mixed outcomes. The effects of outgroup violence were also heterogeneous, with higher exposure leading to stronger ingroup identification and increased prejudice against the outgroup. The study also explores the role of demographic factors, such as age and education, in moderating the impact of violence on social and political attitudes. Younger individuals and those with higher levels of education were more likely to show resilience to the negative effects of ingroup violence, suggesting that these factors play a protective role in post-conflict recovery. The findings highlight the complex interplay between individual experiences, demographic characteristics, and the broader social context in shaping the long-term legacies of violence. The study's detailed analysis of heterogeneous effects provides a nuanced understanding of the different ways in which violence can impact social and political outcomes, offering important insights for policymakers and practitioners working in post-conflict settings.

The study also finds that the impact of war exposure on political and social behavior is most pronounced among those who were directly affected by violence, highlighting the importance of individual experiences in shaping post-war attitudes. These attitudinal outcomes have important implications for understanding the role of war in shaping social capital and collective action in post-conflict societies.","The study provides evidence that war exposure leads to significant behavioral changes, particularly in terms of increased participation in local collective action and political engagement. Individuals who experienced more violence during the war are more likely to attend community meetings, join social and political groups, and contribute to local public goods, such as school committees and road maintenance. These behavioral shifts suggest that war can have positive effects on local governance and collective action, as survivors take an active role in rebuilding their communities. The study also finds that these behavioral effects are consistent across different subsamples, including younger respondents and those living in areas without permanent RUF bases, indicating that the results are robust to potential selection bias. The findings challenge the assumption that war necessarily leads to social fragmentation and disengagement, instead highlighting the potential for conflict to foster increased civic participation and collective action in certain contexts.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the intensity and type of war exposure. The analysis reveals that the impact of violence on collective action is strongest among individuals who experienced the most intense forms of victimization, such as the killing or displacement of household members. The study also finds that the effects are more pronounced in areas where violence was more likely to be indiscriminate, such as regions without permanent RUF bases. These heterogeneous effects highlight the importance of considering both the severity and context of violence when evaluating its impact on social and political behavior. The study's findings suggest that while war can foster increased collective action and civic engagement, these effects are not uniform across all individuals or contexts. The results underscore the need for targeted interventions to support the most affected populations and to harness the potential for collective action in post-conflict reconstruction efforts.",Y,Y,Y,Y,Email study author(s),Yes but we add new outcomes,Yes

The analysis revealed that the impact of abduction on political participation was particularly strong among those who witnessed acts of violence, with each additional act of violence witnessed associated with a 4.2 percentage point increase in the likelihood of voting. The study also found that the effects of abduction varied by the respondents' pre-war household characteristics, such as wealth and parental education, suggesting that the social and economic context in which individuals were raised influenced their resilience and capacity for political engagement. These heterogeneous effects underscore the importance of considering individual and contextual factors when examining the long-term impacts of war on political behavior, and suggest that targeted interventions may be needed to support the political reintegration of former combatants in post-conflict societies.",Y,Y,Y,Y,Email study author(s),Yes but we add new outcomes,Yes

Specifically, it examines whether violence perpetrated by Syrian militants versus Lebanese forces affects these perceptions differently. The research is set in Lebanon, a country hosting over one million refugees from the Syrian Civil War, making it a critical context for understanding the dynamics between host populations and refugees. The study investigates whether exposure to violence by Syrian militants increases perceived security risks associated with refugees, while violence by Lebanese forces decreases these risks. By exploiting the timing of two significant violent events in Lebanon in 2017, the study aims to isolate the causal impact of violence on risk perceptions.

The models controlled for a wide range of individual-level factors, including age, gender, marital status, religious sect, education level, income, prior exposure to violence during the Lebanese Civil War, and proximity to the site of the violent events. The researchers also used propensity score matching to ensure that the treatment and control groups were balanced on these covariates, minimizing the risk of confounding. The use of Ordered Logistic regression allowed the researchers to account for the ordinal nature of the dependent variables, providing a robust analysis of the impact of violence on risk perceptions. The estimation strategy involved a combination of propensity score matching and ordered logistic regression. First, the researchers used propensity score matching to create matched pairs of respondents who were similar in all respects except for the timing of their survey interviews relative to the violent events. This matching process helped to mitigate selection bias and ensure that any differences in risk perceptions could be attributed to the recent exposure to violence. After matching, the researchers estimated ordered logistic regression models to assess the impact of the violent events on respondents' perceptions of security risks. The models included a comprehensive set of controls for individual demographics, socioeconomic status, and prior exposure to violence.

Respondents interviewed after this event were more likely to perceive refugees as a threat to their personal safety, as well as to the safety of their families, communities, and the country as a whole. These findings support the hypothesis that violence perpetrated by out-group militants increases fears and hardens attitudes towards refugees. By contrast, the July 21 Hezbollah-led offensive was associated with a decrease in perceived risks, suggesting that violence by domestic security forces can reassure the public and reduce fears associated with hosting refugees. These attitudinal shifts highlight the complex and context-dependent nature of public attitudes towards refugees in conflict-affected settings. The findings have important implications for understanding how different types of violence influence public support for refugee policies and integration efforts.","The study suggests that the observed attitudinal shifts following violent events could translate into behavioral changes, such as increased support for restrictive refugee policies or greater willingness to engage in anti-refugee actions. While the study primarily focuses on attitudinal outcomes, the findings imply that heightened perceptions of risk could lead to more exclusionary behaviors towards refugees, particularly in the wake of violence by out-group militants. Conversely, the reduction in perceived risks following violence by domestic forces suggests that such events could mitigate exclusionary behaviors and foster a more supportive environment for refugees. The study's findings underscore the potential for recent violence to shape not only public attitudes but also behaviors towards refugees, with significant implications for social cohesion and stability in host communities.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on individual demographics and regional context. For example, older respondents and those with higher levels of prior exposure to violence during the Lebanese Civil War were more likely to perceive refugees as a security threat, particularly following the June 30 attack by Syrian militants. By contrast, respondents living in areas with higher levels of security and socioeconomic stability were less likely to report heightened fears after violent events. These heterogeneous effects suggest that the impact of violence on risk perceptions is not uniform but varies according to individuals' prior experiences, regional context, and socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the importance of considering these diverse factors when designing policies to address public attitudes towards refugees, particularly in conflict-affected settings.

The partial control for survival bias ensures that the study's findings are more robust, but the authors caution that the results should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.",1,"The study finds that the reconciliation intervention significantly increased forgiveness toward former perpetrators and trust in rebel ex-combatants and migrants, two groups that were often marginalized in post-conflict communities. These attitudinal changes suggest that the reconciliation process was successful in fostering greater social cohesion and reducing intergroup tensions. However, the study also finds that the intervention had no significant impact on generalized trust within communities, indicating that the positive effects on trust were specific to certain groups. The findings highlight the potential for reconciliation processes to improve intergroup relations in post-conflict settings, but also suggest that these processes may not lead to broader improvements in social trust. The attitudinal outcomes are important for understanding how reconciliation interventions can contribute to the rebuilding of social capital in communities affected by civil conflict.","The study provides evidence that the reconciliation intervention led to significant behavioral changes, particularly in terms of increased participation in community groups and contributions to public goods. Individuals in treatment sections were more likely to join community organizations, such as Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and religious groups, and to contribute to community projects. These behavioral shifts suggest that the reconciliation process not only improved social cohesion but also enhanced collective action and community engagement. However, the study also finds that these positive social outcomes came at a psychological cost, with individuals in treatment sections experiencing higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. These behavioral outcomes highlight the complex trade-offs involved in reconciliation processes, where the benefits of increased social capital may be offset by negative impacts on individual well-being. The findings underscore the need for careful consideration of these trade-offs in the design and implementation of post-conflict reconciliation interventions.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on individuals' exposure to violence during the war. The analysis reveals that the negative psychological impact of the reconciliation intervention was most pronounced among those who experienced the most severe forms of violence, such as witnessing killings or being physically harmed. In contrast, the positive effects on social capital, such as increased trust and community participation, were more evenly distributed across the population. These heterogeneous effects suggest that while reconciliation processes can foster social cohesion, they may also exacerbate psychological distress among the most traumatized individuals. The study's findings highlight the importance of tailoring reconciliation interventions to address the specific needs of different subgroups within post-conflict populations, particularly those who have experienced the highest levels of trauma. The results underscore the need for targeted mental health support alongside reconciliation efforts to mitigate the negative psychological effects on the most vulnerable individuals.",Y,Y,Y,Y,Email study author(s),,

Despite these limitations, the study's robust sampling and analytical methods provide a strong basis for drawing conclusions about the factors influencing perceptions of ICC bias in Kenya. The authors also conducted robustness checks, including tests for the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) in the multinomial logit model, to ensure the validity of the results..",o,"None, migration bias was not explicitly controlled for in this study. Migration bias is not explicitly addressed in the study, but the focus on regions affected by the post-election violence likely captures populations with varying degrees of displacement. The survey's design, which includes both urban and rural areas, helps mitigate the impact of migration bias by ensuring that the sample includes individuals who may have been displaced during the conflict. However, the authors do not provide detailed information on how migration or displacement status may have affected the respondents' experiences of violence or their perceptions of the ICC. This omission is a potential limitation, as migration and displacement could influence attitudes toward international justice, particularly among those who were forced to leave their homes due to violence. Future research could further explore the impact of migration and displacement on perceptions of the ICC and other international institutions.

The study does not explicitly address survival bias, but the use of a representative sample that includes respondents from regions with high levels of violence helps mitigate this potential issue. The inclusion of respondents who witnessed or were victims of violence ensures that the study captures a range of experiences, including those of individuals who survived the most intense episodes of violence. However, the authors do not discuss the possibility that individuals who were most severely affected by the violence may not have been included in the survey, either due to death, injury, or displacement. This limitation could potentially bias the results, as the study may underrepresent the views of those who were most directly impacted by the conflict. Further research could address this issue by examining the experiences and attitudes of survivors who were not included in the initial sample.",1,"The study finds that exposure to violence significantly reduces the likelihood that respondents perceive the ICC as biased against Africans. This effect is particularly pronounced among Kikuyu and Kalenjin respondents, who are typically more likely to view the ICC as biased due to their ethnic group affiliations. The findings suggest that personal experiences of violence can override ethnic group attachments and lead to more favorable views of international justice institutions. The study also finds that trust in local courts and education level are important determinants of attitudes toward the ICC, with higher levels of trust and education associated with lower perceptions of bias. These results highlight the complex interplay of identity, experience, and trust in shaping public opinion about international institutions. The study contributes to the broader literature on post-conflict justice and the role of international courts in contexts of ethnic conflict and political violence.","The study does not directly examine behavioral outcomes, but it implies that attitudes toward the ICC could influence individuals' willingness to support or participate in international justice processes. The findings suggest that individuals who perceive the ICC as biased are less likely to engage with the court or support its efforts to prosecute those responsible for the post-election violence. Conversely, those who do not perceive bias, particularly those who have experienced violence, may be more likely to support the ICC's work. While the study focuses on attitudes rather than behaviors, the results have implications for understanding how public perceptions of bias can affect the legitimacy and effectiveness of international justice institutions in post-conflict settings. Future research could explore the link between attitudes and behaviors in greater detail, particularly in terms of participation in justice processes and support for accountability measures.",1,"The study finds significant heterogeneous effects based on ethnic identity and exposure to violence. Kikuyu and Kalenjin respondents are more likely to perceive the ICC as biased, but this effect is weakened among those who have experienced violence. The interaction between ethnicity and exposure to violence suggests that personal experiences can moderate the influence of group identities on attitudes toward international justice institutions. The study also finds that education level and trust in local courts have heterogeneous effects, with more educated individuals and those with higher trust in local courts less likely to perceive the ICC as biased. These findings highlight the importance of considering the intersection of identity, experience, and trust in understanding public perceptions of international institutions.

The referendum was intended to ratify a peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), marking the end of a conflict that had lasted for more than 50 years. The study explores how prior experiences of violence, economic conditions, and political support influenced the referendum results. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, the authors analyze the impact of victimization from violence, support for the main opposition party (Centro Democrático), unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation on voting behavior across 860 municipalities. The study finds that while previous victimization increased support for the peace accords, opposition support was the dominant factor in reducing approval for the peace agreement.

This approach allows the authors to account for the nested structure of the data, with municipalities nested within departments. The hierarchical models include both municipal-level and department-level predictors, enabling the analysis of interactions between local and regional factors. The primary dependent variable is the percentage of votes in favor of the peace agreement, modeled as a normally-distributed variable. The models control for a range of socioeconomic and political factors, including support for the opposition party (Centro Democrático), unemployment rates, GDP growth, inflation, and measures of violence and displacement. The Bayesian approach provides robust estimates of the effects of these predictors on the referendum outcome, with posterior estimates obtained after discarding the initial burn-in period and using thinning to reduce autocorrelation. The use of hierarchical models ensures that the study accounts for both within-municipality and between-department variation, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors driving the rejection of the peace agreement in the 2016 referendum. The estimation strategy involves the use of Bayesian hierarchical models to account for the nested structure of the data and to estimate the effects of both municipal-level and department-level predictors on the referendum outcome. The models include a range of covariates, such as support for the opposition party, unemployment rates, GDP growth, inflation, and measures of violence and displacement.

It builds on the hypothesis that civilians’ indirect exposure to war fatalities, especially deaths, fostered in-group solidarity and out-group derogation. The research links this attitudinal shift to increased support for nationalist parties, emphasizing cultural homogeneity and racial superiority. Using county-level data from Weimar Germany, the study tests how these war-related fatalities translated into electoral gains for the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and other right-wing nationalist parties. The authors argue that the psychological effects of war fatalities on civilians, rather than returning veterans, played a significant role in fostering nationalist sentiments. By combining insights from psychology, history, and political science, the study makes a compelling case for how local exposure to war fatalities can fuel nationalism in post-war societies.

The findings underscore the importance of considering media influences in post-conflict reconciliation processes and the potential for media to either bridge or widen ethnic divides. The study's results suggest that targeted media interventions could play a role in reducing ethnic tensions and promoting political stability in post-conflict settings.,1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on village characteristics and individual demographics. Villages closer to the Serbian border, with stronger radio signal strength, exhibit more pronounced effects of Serbian radio exposure on nationalistic behavior. Additionally, the impact of Serbian radio is more substantial in villages with higher pre-existing ethnic tensions and historical significance during the conflict. The laboratory experiment also reveals that individuals with lower baseline ethnic animosity are more susceptible to increased anti-Serbian sentiment after exposure to nationalistic radio content. These findings highlight the need for context-specific approaches in media interventions and post-conflict reconciliation efforts, taking into account the varying susceptibility of different communities and individuals to media influences. The results suggest that tailored strategies could enhance the effectiveness of media interventions in promoting social cohesion and reducing ethnic tensions.",Y,Y,Y,Y,Email study author(s),,

It specifically investigates how the acknowledgment of collective victimization of ethnic Germans expelled after World War II affects attitudes toward contemporary asylum seekers in Germany. The researchers aim to understand if highlighting historical victimization can increase empathy and reduce prejudice toward current outgroups. The study is motivated by the hypothesis that recognizing the suffering of one's own group can foster empathy toward other victimized groups, potentially mitigating outgroup prejudice.

Ethnic Albanians are more likely to actively support and advocate for the provisions of the FA, while ethnic Macedonians exhibit greater resistance and skepticism. This behavioral pattern reflects the deep-rooted ethnic divisions and the challenges of achieving genuine reconciliation in a post-conflict society. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions that address the specific concerns and grievances of different ethnic groups, promoting inclusive and participatory processes to foster long-term peace and stability.

Voters in war-affected municipalities reward incumbents for fiscal activism, suggesting that their war-related experiences lead to a preference for government intervention in economic recovery. This behavioral shift indicates that post-war voters prioritize economic security and are more likely to support politicians who promise and deliver increased public spending. The findings highlight the enduring impact of war trauma on voting behavior.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the level of war exposure and regional differences. Municipalities with higher levels of war-related disabilities show stronger support for fiscally expansionist incumbents. The impact of war trauma on political preferences is also moderated by factors such as settlement size, religiosity, and pre-war spending patterns. Larger settlements and more religious individuals exhibit a stronger preference for government interventionism.

The study explores the transformative potential of war, suggesting that exposure to violence may lead individuals to develop a more inclusive understanding of democracy, emphasizing minority rights and equality. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the role of civil conflict in shaping democratic norms and behaviors, offering insights into how individual experiences of violence can influence broader processes of democratization in post-conflict societies. The study also examines the contextual nature of wartime experiences, considering how the framing of violence by insurgent groups like the PKK can influence support for democratic values.",PJ,Social Science Quarterly,2020, Kurdish Worker's Party insurgency,354,1,South-East Europe,1,Ethnic ingroup - Ethnic outgroup,"Turkish state (Turkish Armed Forces, including the army, air force, and gendarmerie, as well as police forces and intelligence agencies) vs Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)  (PKK guerrilla fighters, primarily based in the southeastern regions of Turkey, as well as in northern Iraq and Syria)",1978,Ongoing,46 ,From the formation of the PKK in 1978 into the the present day,Conflict period between 2010 - 2017,Real,Both (Self-reported and Objective),"Exposure to violence was measured through a comprehensive set of questions that captured both direct and indirect wartime experiences. Direct exposure included events such as the death of a family member, arrest, maltreatment, economic loss, and displacement (both forced and voluntary). Indirect exposure was measured by asking respondents whether they had heard about violent events from others. The study created an aggregate measure of conflict exposure by generating an index based on the arithmetic mean of responses to six conflict-related questions, which included various forms of violence and displacement. This detailed measurement allowed the researchers to analyze the cumulative impact of different types of wartime experiences on political attitudes. The exposure index was used as a key independent variable in the study's regression models, allowing the authors to explore how different levels and types of exposure to violence influenced support for democracy and minority rights. The study also considered how political party preferences, particularly support for pro-Kurdish parties like the HDP, served as proxies for conflict exposure, given the ethnic nature of the conflict. The detailed and multifaceted approach to measuring exposure provided a nuanced understanding of how wartime experiences shape long-term political attitudes in Turkey, particularly among the Kurdish minority.",Individual,"2010, 2016","The study's sample consisted of respondents from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2016. The 2010 survey included 9,931 respondents, while the 2016 survey included 2,529 respondents. The surveys used a multistage, stratified, cluster-sampling technique to ensure representativeness across different geographic regions and population strata. The sample included a significant number of Kurdish respondents, who were disproportionately affected by the conflict, as well as Turkish respondents from various regions of the country. The surveys captured a wide range of demographic variables, including gender, age, education level, and political party preferences, allowing for a detailed analysis of how these factors interact with wartime experiences to shape attitudes toward democracy. The sample also included individuals with varying levels of exposure to violence, from those who had direct experiences of violence (e.g., death of a family member, arrest, displacement) to those who had not been directly affected by the conflict. This diversity in the sample allowed the authors to explore the nuanced effects of wartime experiences on support for democracy, particularly in terms of how these experiences differ between Kurds and Turks. The large sample size and comprehensive data collection methods ensured that the findings were robust and generalizable to the broader Turkish population, with a particular focus on the Kurdish minority.",0,"None, no pre-war data are used in this study",Individual,Ordered Logistic ,"The study employed Ordered Logistic regression models to examine the relationship between wartime experiences and support for democratic values. The models controlled for various socio-demographic factors, including gender, age, education level, and political party preferences. The regression analysis was conducted separately for the 2010 and 2016 survey data, allowing the authors to explore how the relationship between conflict exposure and political attitudes evolved over time, particularly in response to changes in the conflict environment. The models included both direct and indirect measures of conflict exposure, as well as interaction terms to explore how political party preferences moderated the relationship between exposure to violence and support for democracy. The use of ordered logistic regression was appropriate given the ordinal nature of the dependent variables, which measured attitudes toward democracy and minority rights on a Likert scale. The models also included robustness checks, such as alternative model specifications and sensitivity analyses, to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The comprehensive modelling approach allowed the authors to disentangle the complex relationships between wartime experiences, political party preferences, and support for democratic values, providing robust insights into the micro-level impacts of civil war on democratization in Turkey. The estimation strategy involved the use of ordered logistic regression models, with separate analyses conducted for the 2010 and 2016 survey data. The models controlled for a range of socio-demographic factors, including gender, age, education level, and political party preferences, to isolate the effects of conflict exposure on support for democratic values. The key independent variable was an index of conflict exposure, which was used to test the study's hypotheses about the relationship between wartime experiences and support for democracy. The authors also explored the moderating effects of political party preferences, particularly support for pro-Kurdish parties like the HDP, on the relationship between conflict exposure and political attitudes. The models included interaction terms to capture these moderating effects, as well as robustness checks to ensure the stability of the results. The use of ordered logistic regression was appropriate given the ordinal nature of the dependent variables, and the authors conducted additional sensitivity analyses, including tests for potential omitted variable bias and alternative model specifications, to confirm the reliability of the findings.

The authors also controlled for a range of socio-demographic variables, including gender, age, education level, and political party preferences, to account for potential selection bias in the sample. The robustness checks conducted as part of the estimation strategy, including alternative model specifications and sensitivity analyses, further helped to mitigate the risk of selection bias affecting the study's findings. By using a representative sample and controlling for relevant covariates, the study minimized the potential for selection bias, making the results more generalizable to the broader population of war-affected individuals in Turkey. The comprehensive approach to addressing selection bias ensures that the study's conclusions about the relationship between conflict exposure and support for democracy are well-supported by the data.",1,"The study controlled for migration bias by including variables related to displacement, such as whether the respondent had been forced to flee their home due to the conflict. Given the high levels of displacement during the Kurdish-Turkish conflict, it was crucial to account for potential differences between those who were displaced and those who remained in their communities. The study also considered the impact of migration on political attitudes, particularly in terms of how displacement may have influenced support for democracy and minority rights. By addressing migration bias, the study provides more accurate estimates of the impact of war-related experiences on political attitudes, particularly among the Kurdish minority, who were disproportionately affected by displacement during the conflict. The detailed measurement of displacement and migration patterns helps ensure that the findings are not confounded by these factors, providing a clearer picture of the long-term impacts of war on political attitudes in Turkey. The authors conducted robustness checks to confirm that the results were not driven by migration-related biases, further strengthening the validity of the study's conclusions.",0,"None, survival bias was not explicitly controlled for in this study. The study partially addressed survival bias by controlling for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and using a representative sample that included individuals with varying levels of war exposure. However, the authors acknowledged that survival bias might still be a concern, as the data only included individuals who survived the conflict and were available to participate in the surveys. The study does not have data on those who did not survive the conflict, which could potentially bias the results if those who died had systematically different levels of support for democracy. While the authors conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of their findings, they noted that survival bias could not be fully eliminated and should be considered when interpreting the results. Despite this limitation, the study provides valuable insights into the psychological and political legacies of war for the surviving Kurdish and Turkish populations in Turkey. The comprehensive approach to addressing survival bias ensures that the study's conclusions are well-supported by the data, even if some biases remain",1,"The study finds that exposure to violence during the Kurdish-Turkish conflict is significantly associated with greater support for democratic values, particularly among the Kurdish minority. Individuals who experienced higher levels of violence were more likely to support democracy, with a specific emphasis on equality and minority rights. The study also finds that political party preferences play a crucial role in shaping these attitudes, with supporters of the pro-Kurdish HDP showing the strongest support for democratic values. The findings suggest that wartime experiences can foster a more inclusive understanding of democracy, particularly in societies where ethnic minorities have been historically marginalized. The study contributes to the broader literature on the democratization potential of civil war by highlighting the complex ways in which violence can shape political attitudes, both positively and negatively. The attitudinal outcomes of the study provide important insights into how conflict exposure influences support for democracy, particularly in terms of minority rights and constitutional equality. The findings also underscore the importance of political party affiliations in mediating the relationship between wartime experiences and democratic attitudes, suggesting that the framing of the conflict by political actors plays a key role in shaping individual responses to violence.","While the primary focus of the study is on attitudinal outcomes, the findings also have implications for political behavior, particularly in terms of voting patterns and support for political parties. The study suggests that exposure to violence may lead to increased political engagement, particularly among those who support pro-Kurdish parties like the HDP. The findings indicate that individuals who experienced higher levels of violence were more likely to support parties that emphasize democratic values, minority rights, and constitutional equality. The study also finds that political party preferences are strongly associated with support for democracy, suggesting that wartime experiences may influence not only individual attitudes but also broader patterns of political behavior. The behavioral implications of the study are particularly relevant in the context of Turkey, where the Kurdish minority has been historically marginalized and where political parties play a key role in shaping the political landscape. The study's findings suggest that wartime experiences can lead to increased support for parties that advocate for democratic reforms, particularly among marginalized groups like the Kurds. These behavioral outcomes provide important insights into the long-term impacts of civil war on political engagement and democratization, offering new perspectives on the role of conflict in shaping political behavior in post-conflict societies.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on ethnic identity, political party preferences, and the level of conflict exposure. The findings indicate that Kurds who were exposed to higher levels of violence were more likely to support democracy, particularly in terms of minority rights and constitutional equality. However, the study also finds that these effects are moderated by political party preferences, with supporters of the pro-Kurdish HDP showing the strongest support for democratic values. The study suggests that the framing of the conflict by political actors plays a crucial role in shaping these heterogeneous effects, with different groups responding to violence in different ways depending on their political affiliations and ethnic identities. The study also explores the role of gender and education level in moderating the relationship between conflict exposure and support for democracy, finding that women and less-educated individuals were more likely to support democratic values in the context of conflict. These heterogeneous effects provide important insights into the complex ways in which wartime experiences shape political attitudes and behaviors, offering a nuanced understanding of the micro-level processes that drive democratization in post-conflict societies. The study's detailed analysis of heterogeneous effects underscores the importance of considering the contextual and individual-level factors that influence the relationship between conflict exposure and support for democracy, providing valuable guidance for policymakers and practitioners working to promote democratic values in conflict-affected regions.",Y,N,Y,N,Email study author(s),,

It focuses on whether violence during ethnic warfare increases support for ethnic parties in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina. The authors hypothesize that exposure to violence makes ethnic identities more salient, leading individuals to retreat into their ethnic communities and develop greater distrust of out-groups. This retreat and distrust, in turn, increase support for political parties with ethnic appeals.

Specifically, the research explores how direct exposure to violence and terrorism influences psychological distress and threat perceptions, which in turn affect individuals' willingness to support peace negotiations and compromises. The study operates within a framework that posits that prolonged exposure to violence leads to heightened psychological distress, which is a key driver of increased threat perceptions and a subsequent reduction in support for peace initiatives. The research draws on the ""stress-based model of political extremism"" and the ""Shattered Assumptions theory"" to explain how psychological trauma resulting from violence can lead to defensive coping mechanisms, such as inflexibility and unwillingness to compromise in the political realm. By examining the micro-foundations of conflict through the lens of individual experiences, the study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological barriers to peace in protracted conflicts.

However, the study does not fully eliminate the possibility of survival bias, as it is inherently difficult to control for in conflict settings.",1,"The study finds that exposure to political violence significantly increases psychological distress and threat perceptions, which in turn lead to more negative attitudes toward peace. Individuals who are exposed to violence are more likely to experience heightened psychological distress, which amplifies their perceptions of threat from the opposing group.

The study highlights the importance of addressing psychological distress and threat perceptions in order to foster more favorable attitudes toward peace in conflict settings. These attitudinal shifts have important implications for the prospects of resolving protracted conflicts, as they suggest that prolonged exposure to violence can entrench intransigence and hinder efforts to achieve peace.","The study does not specifically focus on behavioral outcomes, but the findings suggest that the attitudinal changes resulting from exposure to violence may translate into more militant and exclusionary behaviors. Individuals who experience higher levels of psychological distress and threat perceptions are likely to adopt more rigid and uncompromising stances in their political and social interactions, potentially leading to increased support for hardline policies and resistance to peace initiatives.

These heterogeneous effects highlight the complexity of the relationship between exposure to violence, psychological distress, and political attitudes, suggesting that different groups may respond differently to similar experiences of violence.

The sample is representative of the broader South Korean population, with geographic information provided at the EMD level, allowing for precise analysis of the effects of violence on political attitudes. The sample is divided into pre-war and post-war cohorts to compare the effects of trauma and stigma.",1,The study uses pre-war data to establish a baseline for the analysis. The pre-war data is used to compare the political attitudes of cohorts born before and after the war in areas that did and did not experience violence. This comparison allows the authors to isolate the effects of wartime violence from pre-existing differences in political attitudes. The inclusion of pre-war data strengthens the identification strategy by providing a reference point for assessing the long-term effects of violence on political trust.,Individual,Ordinary Least Squares,"The study employs a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to estimate the effects of wartime violence on political attitudes. The DID approach compares the pre- and post-war cohorts within violence-affected areas to isolate the effects of trauma and stigma. The analysis includes a variety of fixed effects, including EMD-level fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity between areas. The dependent variables are measures of trust in government institutions, with trust levels coded on a 1-3 scale. The models control for a range of individual-level covariates, including gender, employment status, marital status, religious attendance, social rank, and education level. The DID strategy allows the authors to separate the effects of trauma from those of stigma by focusing on the differences between cohorts exposed to violence during the war and those born after the war. The estimation strategy involves using a DID approach with EMD-level fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity. The models include interaction terms between the violence exposure variable and the pre-war cohort variable to estimate the trauma effects, while the main effects capture the stigma effects. The analysis is conducted separately for different government institutions, including the central government, the Blue House, the military, and the legislature. Robust standard errors are clustered at the EMD level to account for spatial correlation in the data. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test the robustness of the results, including varying the cut-off points for violence exposure and using different definitions of the pre-war and post-war cohorts.

However, the analysis is limited by the available data, which does not include detailed migration histories of respondents. The authors mitigate this concern by focusing on the pre-war and post-war cohorts within the same EMDs, assuming that migration patterns would not systematically differ between these cohorts. The use of fixed effects at the EMD level also helps to control for some of the unobserved factors related to migration. Nevertheless, the authors note that migration bias cannot be entirely ruled out and suggest that future research could address this limitation with more detailed migration data.",1,"The study partially addresses survival bias by focusing on individuals who survived the war and were able to participate in the survey. The authors acknowledge that those who died during the war or who suffered severe trauma may have different political attitudes than the survivors, which could bias the results. The use of a difference-in-differences approach helps to mitigate this bias by comparing similar cohorts within the same geographic areas. However, the authors recognize that survival bias cannot be completely eliminated, as the analysis is based on the survivors' responses. The study suggests that the observed effects may underestimate the true impact of wartime violence on political attitudes, as those most affected by the violence may not have survived to be included in the sample.",1,"The study finds that individuals exposed to violence during their formative years (ages 0-5) exhibit significantly lower levels of trust in the South Korean government, reflecting the long-term impact of trauma on political attitudes. This effect is particularly pronounced for trust in the central government and the military, institutions closely associated with the violence during the war. In contrast, individuals born after the war in violence-affected areas exhibit higher levels of trust in the government, suggesting that stigma against the victims of violence may lead to greater identification with state institutions. The findings highlight the complex interplay between trauma and stigma in shaping political attitudes, with both direct and indirect effects of wartime violence influencing trust in government institutions over the long term.","The study also finds evidence that trauma and stigma influence political behavior. Respondents exposed to violence during the war are less likely to participate in political activities or express support for government policies, reflecting a deep-seated mistrust of state institutions. In contrast, individuals born after the war in violence-affected areas are more likely to engage in political activities and express support for the government, as they seek to distance themselves from the stigmatized victims of violence. These behavioral patterns underscore the lasting impact of wartime violence on political engagement, with trauma leading to political disengagement and stigma promoting greater political participation. The study's findings have important implications for understanding the long-term effects of violence on political behavior and the challenges of building trust in post-conflict societies.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on age and the type of violence experienced.

Many died in the months and years following the deportation due to these harsh conditions.

The Crimean Tatars remained in exile for decades, with a significant portion of the population not being allowed to return to Crimea until the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

These groups received vignettes describing various targeting tactics (military targeting, discriminate civilian targeting, indiscriminate civilian targeting) by both Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups. This random assignment helps ensure that the observed effects are causally attributable to the treatment conditions. 2. Multivariate Regression Models: To estimate the effects of the treatment conditions on public approval, the study uses multivariate regression models. These models control for a range of demographic variables such as gender, age, education, income, ethnicity, and language preference (Russian/Ukrainian). They also control for political attitudes, including trust in the Ukrainian government, military, and separatist forces. By including these controls, the models aim to isolate the effects of the targeting tactics from other confounding factors. 3. Interaction Terms: The regression models incorporate interaction terms to test for heterogeneous treatment effects. This means examining whether the impact of the targeting tactics varies based on respondents' demographic characteristics and prior attitudes. For example, the study explores whether the effects differ between respondents with high trust in the Ukrainian government versus those with low trust, or between pro-Russian respondents and pro-Ukrainian respondents. 4. Robustness Checks: Several robustness checks are conducted to ensure the validity of the findings. These include manipulation checks to confirm that respondents understood the treatment vignettes as intended and trustworthiness checks to verify the reliability of the survey responses. The study also tests for the stability of the results by using alternative model specifications and excluding outliers. 5. Sensitivity Analyses: Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the potential impact of unobserved confounders. These analyses involve re-estimating the models under different assumptions and examining how sensitive the results are to changes in the model specifications. This helps to ensure that the findings are robust to various sources of potential bias. 6. Random Assignment: The use of random assignment in the survey experiment is a crucial component of the estimation strategy. Random assignment helps mitigate selection bias and ensures that any differences in outcomes between the treatment groups can be attributed to the treatment conditions rather than pre-existing differences between respondents. 7.

Evidence from Chechnya,Russia,"This study investigates the counterintuitive effects of indiscriminate violence by state forces on insurgent activity, using Russian artillery strikes in Chechnya as a case study. The conventional wisdom suggests that indiscriminate violence by state actors incites further insurgent attacks by increasing grievances among the affected population and compelling them to join or support insurgent movements. However, this study explores the possibility that indiscriminate violence might actually suppress insurgent activity under certain conditions. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of Russian artillery strikes on Chechen villages from 2000 to 2005, the study examines whether such violence reduces the mean number of insurgent attacks in targeted villages compared to similar but non-shelled villages. The research utilizes a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to compare changes in insurgent attacks before and after artillery strikes, providing a nuanced understanding of the relationship between state violence and insurgent responses.

This behavior is consistent across different measures of social capital, suggesting that trust, norms, and reliance on social networks are key drivers of prosocial behavior in post-conflict settings. The study also finds that victims of violence are willing to extend prosocial behavior to more distant social groups, although the level of giving decreases as social distance increases. This pattern of behavior highlights the potential for social capital to facilitate cooperation and collective action in post-conflict societies, even in the face of deep social divisions created by wartime violence. The findings contribute to the broader literature on the long-term behavioral effects of conflict, providing evidence that prosocial behavior can emerge in the aftermath of violence, particularly when supported by strong social capital.

Victims of violence are more likely to display prosocial behavior towards members of their own farmer groups, where social capital is highest. However, this effect diminishes as the social distance between the participants and the recipients increases, indicating that prosocial behavior is more likely to occur within close-knit social networks. The study also finds that social capital moderates the relationship between victimization and prosocial behavior, with higher levels of social capital leading to greater prosocial behavior among victims. These findings underscore the importance of social capital in shaping post-conflict behavior and highlight the potential for targeted interventions to strengthen social networks and promote cooperation in post-conflict settings.

The research investigates whether state-led violent repression can push peripheral minorities to identify more strongly with their ethnic group or even with a neighboring irredentist state like Pakistan, rather than with the Indian nation. By employing a novel experimental design that randomizes exposure to videos depicting actual ethnic violence and police repression, the study seeks to understand how such exposure impacts Kashmiri people's feelings toward the Indian state and their support for irredentism. The study draws on social identity theories to test hypotheses about the role of violence, psychological distance, and national status in shaping social identification. It also examines whether integrative institutions or perceptions of economic growth can mitigate the effects of violence on ethnic and national identification. This research contributes to the broader literature on separatism, irredentism, and nation-building by providing micro-level data from an ongoing conflict in one of the world's most volatile regions.

The increased likelihood of blaming the government among those exposed to violence indicates that state indiscriminate attacks may drive civilians to collaborate with insurgents or withdraw support from the state, particularly in areas heavily affected by the conflict. These potential behavioral implications underscore the importance of understanding how state violence is perceived by civilians and how these perceptions can shape the dynamics of civil conflicts.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on civilians' exposure to bombing and their geographic location.

These heterogeneous effects highlight the importance of personal experience in shaping civilians' perceptions of state violence, with those directly affected by the conflict being less willing to excuse state actions. The study also finds that ethnic identity and language use may moderate these effects, with Russian-speaking and ethnically Russian respondents being more likely to blame the government, regardless of exposure.

The Correlates of hosting IDPs,Democratic Republic of Congo,"The study focuses on understanding what motivates people to host internally displaced persons (IDPs) within their own countries. The authors investigate whether empathy, along with other factors like ethnicity, wealth, religiosity, and security concerns, affects the willingness to host. The study explores the role of empathy in particular, testing whether empathy can be an important driver of hosting behaviors in conflict-affected areas. The study also examines alternative explanations such as hosting for potential economic gain or reciprocity, given that hosting could be seen as a cooperative behavior. Set in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where millions of people have been displaced due to ongoing violence, the study aims to provide insights into how households decide to open their doors to strangers, thereby contributing to the literature on forced displacement and hosting in conflict-ridden regions.

The study also finds that other factors, such as ethnicity and religiosity, are not significant predictors of hosting behavior, challenging common assumptions about the role of ethnic or religious solidarity in humanitarian responses. These attitudinal outcomes suggest that fostering empathy, rather than relying on ethnic or religious bonds, may be key to increasing the willingness to host displaced individuals in conflict settings.","In terms of actual behavior, the study shows that 21% of households in the sample hosted strangers (IDPs they did not know) during the ten-month period. Households with higher levels of empathy were more likely to take in displaced persons, even when controlling for other factors like wealth and security. The experimental results, however, suggest that interventions aimed at increasing empathy, religiosity, or authority-based appeals do not significantly affect hosting behavior in the long term.

The research addresses whether voters punish incumbents for policy failures such as failing to protect the population from aerial attacks. It challenges existing literature that often assumes strategic bombing has only temporary effects, such as rallying around the leader, with no significant long-term political consequences. The study fills a gap by focusing on a competitive autocracy where multiparty elections occur but are subject to manipulation. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, the research provides evidence that bombed municipalities saw a significant decline in vote share for Slobodan Milosevic’s regime in the 2000 elections. The study’s findings suggest that even in competitive autocracies, voters may hold leaders accountable for wartime failures, indicating the presence of retrospective voting mechanisms.

The research is grounded in the broader context of political tolerance, which is essential for the peaceful coexistence of opposing groups and the consolidation of democracy. The study seeks to understand whether war experiences uniformly reduce political tolerance or if positive psychological developments such as PTG can increase tolerance. The findings are crucial for understanding the challenges and opportunities for reconciliation in post-conflict societies, particularly in contexts where the defeated party (in this case, the Tamils) suffered significant victimization. By focusing on the psychological legacies of war, the study provides a nuanced analysis of how traumatic experiences shape political attitudes and behaviors in the long term.

The path model included direct effects of war exposure on political tolerance, as well as indirect effects mediated by war-related distress and PTG. The analysis revealed that while war exposure generally reduced political tolerance, PTG could mitigate some of these negative effects, particularly when it involved external growth, such as increased spiritual beliefs or a greater sense of closeness to others. The use of path analysis provided a detailed picture of how different psychological pathways mediate the relationship between war experiences and political attitudes, offering insights into the potential for reconciliation in post-conflict societies. The study also conducted robustness checks, including separate models for different civil liberties and sensitivity analyses, to ensure the validity of the findings. The estimation strategy involved path analysis, which is particularly suited for exploring complex relationships involving multiple mediators and outcomes.

These attitudinal shifts suggest that psychological recovery and growth can play a crucial role in promoting reconciliation and peace in post-conflict societies. The study highlights the complex and sometimes contradictory effects of war on political attitudes, showing that while war exposure often leads to decreased tolerance, the potential for positive psychological change offers a pathway toward greater inclusivity and peacebuilding. These findings have important implications for post-conflict reconciliation efforts, suggesting that promoting PTG could be a valuable strategy for fostering political tolerance and bridging divides in deeply divided societies.","The study did not directly measure behavioral outcomes, focusing instead on attitudinal measures of political tolerance. However, the findings suggest that the attitudinal changes observed—such as increased willingness to grant civil liberties to former enemies—could translate into more inclusive political behaviors, such as supporting policies that promote reconciliation and peacebuilding. The link between attitudinal and behavioral outcomes is implied through the study's focus on political tolerance, which is often seen as a precursor to more inclusive and democratic behaviors. While the study does not provide direct evidence of behavioral changes, the strong association between psychological pathways (such as PTG) and political tolerance suggests that fostering positive psychological recovery in post-conflict settings could have broader implications for the development of democratic norms and practices. The potential for attitudinal shifts to influence behaviors is an important area for future research, particularly in understanding how psychological recovery processes can contribute to the long-term stability and peace of post-conflict societies.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the type and intensity of war-related experiences, as well as the psychological pathways involved. For example, individuals who experienced higher levels of war-related distress were more likely to exhibit lower levels of political tolerance, while those who experienced external PTG were more likely to be tolerant. The study also explores the moderating role of demographic factors, such as gender and age, finding that women were more likely to experience war-related distress and less likely to exhibit external PTG, which in turn influenced their levels of political tolerance. The findings suggest that the impact of war exposure on political tolerance is not uniform but varies according to individual experiences and psychological outcomes. The study's detailed analysis of heterogeneous effects provides a nuanced understanding of how different factors interact to shape political attitudes in post-conflict settings, offering important insights for policymakers and practitioners working to promote reconciliation and peace in divided societies. The identification of these heterogeneous effects underscores the complexity of the post-conflict recovery process and the need for tailored interventions that address the specific needs and experiences of different groups.",Y,N,Y,Y,Email study author(s),No,Yes

It aims to understand whether past violence makes individuals more likely to support secession or cling to the territorial status quo. The researchers analyze whether exposure to civil war events and subsequent repression by Francoist forces influenced secessionist attitudes, focusing on whether the sense of political apathy and disaffection among the oldest cohort exposed to violence is transmitted to subsequent generations. The study leverages a large dataset combining individual-level survey data with historical records of repression and violence in Catalan municipalities.

The focus on the oldest cohort who experienced the violence during their formative years helps to capture the long-term effects of repression.",1,"The study finds that exposure to violence and repression during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath significantly decreases support for Catalan independence among the oldest cohort. The negative impact on secessionist preferences is primarily due to increased political apathy and fatalism among those who experienced high levels of violence. The findings suggest that the memory of past violence leads to a reluctance to support disruptive political changes, such as secession, among the affected individuals.","The study shows that the oldest cohort exposed to higher levels of violence is less likely to support Catalan independence, exhibiting a preference for maintaining the territorial status quo.

Specifically, the effects of induced anger on retaliatory behavior differ between high-threat (Sderot) and low-threat (Ofakim) environments. In Sderot, which experiences high levels of rocket fire and continuous threat, individuals exhibit a decreased likelihood and extent of punishment when angered. This suggests that continued exposure to violence makes individuals more sensitive to perceived negative actions and less likely to engage in retaliatory behavior. The high level of threat in Sderot may condition individuals to avoid actions that could further escalate conflict or provoke additional violence within their community. Conversely, in Ofakim, which faces a lower threat level, individuals are more likely to engage in retaliatory behavior when angered. The lower exposure to violence in Ofakim means that the immediate risk of escalation is perceived to be lower, allowing anger to translate more directly into punitive actions against community members. This behavior indicates that in environments with less constant threat, individuals feel more able to express their anger through retaliation without the same level of fear of immediate repercussions. The study suggests that the long-term impact of violence and threat shapes emotional responses and behavioral norms, influencing how individuals within communities respond to provocation and conflict. The conditional effect of anger and exposure to violence highlights the complex interplay between emotional states and environmental context. In high-threat settings, the constant exposure to violence appears to condition individuals to prioritize stability and avoid further conflict, even when provoked. In contrast, in low-threat settings, the reduced immediate danger allows anger to manifest in retaliatory behaviors.",Y,Y,Y,Y,Email study author(s),N,Y

These effects are robust to various controls and highlight the complex interplay between conflict type, religious identity, and social preferences. The findings demonstrate that the nature of conflict exposure can differentially impact social preferences, necessitating context-specific approaches to post-conflict reconciliation and peacebuilding. For instance, efforts to rebuild trust and foster social cohesion in areas affected by inter-religious/ethnic conflicts might need to address deep-seated grievances and identity-based divisions, while regions affected by indiscriminate conflicts could benefit from initiatives that strengthen in-group solidarity and collective resilience.",N,N,N,N,In Process,,

The research focuses on the role of empathy in prompting civic actions among citizens who are not direct victims of violence but who feel a connection to victims. The central argument is that indirect victims—those who witness or learn about violence affecting others—are motivated to engage in civic activities through empathy, which leads them to imagine themselves in the place of the victims. This sense of empathy generates a vicarious sense of vulnerability, linking the interests of indirect victims with those of direct victims and prompting civic engagement aimed at addressing violence.

For example, those who engaged in positive religious coping behaviors, such as seeking comfort in their faith community or finding meaning in their suffering through religious beliefs, were more likely to report lower levels of PTSD symptoms. Conversely, participants who engaged in negative religious coping behaviors, such as feeling that they were being punished by God, were more likely to report higher levels of PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that religiosity influences not only psychological outcomes but also the behavioral strategies that individuals use to cope with trauma. The study's behavioral implications are particularly relevant for practitioners working with refugee populations, as they underscore the importance of incorporating religious and spiritual considerations into mental health interventions.",1,"The study explored heterogeneous effects by examining how the relationship between religiosity and PTSD symptoms varied across different subgroups within the sample. For instance, the researchers investigated whether the effects of religiosity differed by gender, age, or religious affiliation. They found that the protective effects of positive religious coping were more pronounced among older participants and those who identified as Christian. In contrast, younger participants and those who identified as Muslim did not show as strong a relationship between positive religious coping and lower PTSD symptoms. The study also found that the negative effects of negative religious coping were particularly severe among participants who had experienced the most extreme forms of trauma. These findings suggest that the impact of religiosity on PTSD symptoms is not uniform across all individuals but is instead influenced by a range of demographic and contextual factors.

The analysis highlights significant variations across different groups and conflict phases, revealing the complex interplay between personal experiences of violence and broader socio-political contexts.

Demographic Differences:

    Gender: The study finds gender differences in the impact of EPV on psychological distress and threat perceptions. Women, in particular, show higher levels of psychological distress following exposure to political violence compared to men. This heightened distress among women is linked to stronger threat perceptions and lower levels of support for conciliatory measures. The findings suggest that women’s psychological responses to violence may be influenced by their social roles and responsibilities, which can exacerbate the impact of conflict experiences on their attitudes toward peace.
    Age: Younger individuals exhibit more pronounced effects of EPV on psychological distress and threat perceptions compared to older individuals. The study suggests that younger people, who are still in formative stages of psychological development, may be more vulnerable to the long-term impacts of violence. This heightened vulnerability can lead to stronger negative reactions to peace processes and lower levels of support for compromise with the opposing group.

Conflict Phase Differences:

    Ongoing vs. Post-Conflict: The impact of EPV varies significantly between ongoing and post-conflict phases. In the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, exposure to violence leads to immediate and strong increases in psychological distress and threat perceptions, which directly reduce support for peace agreements and conciliatory attitudes. In the post-conflict setting of Northern Ireland, while the effects of past violence are still evident, there is a noticeable reduction in the intensity of psychological distress and threat perceptions over time. This reduction is attributed to the stabilization brought about by the peace process and the passage of time, which allows for some psychological healing and adjustment.
    Group-Specific Effects: The study highlights that the effects of EPV on psychological distress and threat perceptions are mediated by group-specific narratives and historical contexts. For instance, among Israeli Jews, exposure to violence by Palestinians reinforces historical narratives of existential threat, leading to heightened psychological distress and lower support for concessions. Conversely, among Palestinians, EPV by Israeli forces strengthens perceptions of injustice and victimization, similarly resulting in increased distress and opposition to peace measures that do not address their grievances. In Northern Ireland, the narratives of past violence and the roles of different groups during The Troubles continue to influence how individuals process and respond to EPV, with Protestant and Catholic communities exhibiting distinct patterns of psychological distress and support for peace initiatives.

Psychological Mechanisms:

    Perceived Threat: Perceived threat emerges as a critical mechanism through which EPV influences conciliatory attitudes. The study finds that individuals who perceive higher levels of personal and family threat due to political violence are significantly less likely to support peace processes. This perception of threat not only stems from direct experiences of violence but is also shaped by the broader social and political environment, including media portrayals and community narratives.
    Psychological Distress: Psychological distress, measured by posttraumatic stress symptoms, plays a central role in mediating the relationship between EPV and attitudes toward peace. High levels of psychological distress lead to increased feelings of fear, anger, and distrust, which undermine support for compromise and reconciliation efforts. The study underscores the need for mental health interventions as part of post-conflict peacebuilding to address the enduring effects of psychological distress on political attitudes.

Implications for Peacebuilding:

    Addressing Psychological Barriers: The study emphasizes that successful peacebuilding must go beyond addressing the real threat of violence to also tackle the psychological barriers to peace. This includes providing comprehensive mental health support to individuals affected by conflict, promoting social and political inclusion, and fostering narratives that mitigate fear and build trust between opposing groups.
    Tailored Interventions: Peacebuilding efforts need to be tailored to the specific needs of different demographic groups and conflict phases. For instance, interventions targeting women and younger individuals may require different approaches compared to those for men and older populations. Additionally, ongoing conflict settings may necessitate immediate psychological support and safety assurances, while post-conflict settings can focus on long-term reconciliation and healing processes.",N,N,N,N,In Process,No,Yes

The study finds that younger respondents (aged 15-34 years) tend to have better mental health outcomes and social functioning, indicating that age is a significant factor in the impact of trauma. Gender: Women report higher levels of PTSD symptoms and are more likely to experience poorer social functioning compared to men. However, men express stronger feelings of revenge and a greater likelihood of acting on these feelings. This suggests that gender plays a crucial role in shaping the psychological and behavioral responses to conflict. Marital Status: Widowed respondents have significantly worse mental health outcomes and social functioning compared to those who are married, divorced, or single. The loss of a spouse appears to exacerbate the psychological impact of the war.
Type of Trauma: Forced Separation and Murder of Family/Friends: Respondents who experienced forced separation from family members or the murder of a family member or friend have significantly higher GHQ-28 scores, indicating worse psychiatric morbidity. They also show a higher prevalence of PTSD symptoms and poorer social functioning. These specific traumatic events have a profound impact on mental health, highlighting the severe psychological toll of such experiences. Number of Traumatic Events: There is a significant linear relationship between the number of traumatic events experienced and worse mental health outcomes. Respondents who reported experiencing eight or more traumatic events have notably higher GHQ-28 scores, lower MOS-20 social functioning scores, and a higher prevalence of PTSD symptoms. This cumulative effect of trauma underscores the importance of considering the overall trauma burden in assessing mental health needs.
Displacement Status: Internally Displaced vs. Refugees: Internally displaced persons (IDPs) have worse mental health outcomes compared to refugees and those who did not move during the conflict. IDPs report higher GHQ-28 scores, indicating greater psychiatric morbidity, and face significant challenges in social functioning. Refugees, while also affected, tend to have slightly better outcomes, possibly due to access to support systems in refugee camps or host countries. Non-movers: Individuals who did not move during the conflict generally have better mental health and social functioning outcomes compared to IDPs and refugees. This group experienced fewer traumatic events on average, which may contribute to their relatively better psychological resilience.
Psychological Resilience and Social Support: The study highlights the role of social support and community engagement in mitigating the adverse effects of trauma. Respondents with stronger social networks and community ties tend to have better mental health outcomes and social functioning. This finding suggests that interventions aimed at strengthening social support systems and fostering community cohesion could be effective in promoting psychological recovery and resilience among conflict-affected populations.",N,N,N,N,In Process,No,Yes

Individuals who were exposed to combat during their critical pre-school years exhibit lower levels of trust in others compared to those who were not exposed or exposed at older ages. This decline in trust persists into adulthood, suggesting that early traumatic experiences have lasting effects on social preferences.","    Impact on Social Engagement: Reduced trust resulting from early combat exposure translates into lower social engagement in adulthood. Individuals with lower trust levels are less likely to participate in community activities, join social groups, or engage in collective action. This reduced social engagement can undermine social cohesion and collective efficacy in post-conflict societies.
    Economic and Institutional Moderation: The study finds that regions with strong post-war economic recovery and effective institutional development experience smaller declines in trust levels. Economic stability and good governance can mitigate the negative long-term effects of early-life exposure to violence, highlighting the importance of robust post-conflict reconstruction efforts.
    Role of Social Networks: Strong family and community support systems during and after the war can help buffer the impact of early combat exposure on trust. Individuals with access to supportive social networks show smaller declines in trust, indicating that social support plays a crucial role in resilience to early-life trauma.",1,"
Demographic Differences: Age at Exposure: The study finds that the long-term effects on trust are more pronounced for individuals who were exposed to combat during their critical pre-school years (ages 0-6). This period is crucial for psychological and social development, making young children particularly vulnerable to the impacts of violence and instability. The research suggests that exposure during these formative years leads to more significant and lasting reductions in trust levels compared to those exposed at older ages. Gender: The analysis reveals that the impact of war exposure on trust differs between men and women. Women exposed to combat during early childhood show larger declines in trust levels compared to men. This finding may reflect gender-specific coping mechanisms and socialization processes, where early traumatic experiences have a different psychological impact on women, potentially influencing their social preferences and trust in others more strongly.

Type of War Exposure:  Intensity of Combat: The study differentiates between various types of combat exposure, such as bombings, ground attacks, and city captures. It finds that the intensity and frequency of combat events significantly influence the long-term impact on trust. Regions that experienced more intense and frequent combat events show larger reductions in trust levels among individuals exposed during early childhood. This suggests that the severity of exposure plays a crucial role in shaping social preferences and trust in adulthood. Cumulative Exposure: The cumulative exposure to combat over the war period also matters. Individuals from regions with prolonged periods of combat or repeated exposure to violent events exhibit more substantial declines in trust. The study highlights that not only the intensity but also the duration and recurrence of traumatic experiences are important factors determining the long-term effects on trust.

Regional Differences: Variation Across Countries: The impact of early-life exposure to World War II on trust varies significantly across different European countries and regions. For instance, individuals from regions that faced occupation and prolonged combat, such as certain areas in Eastern Europe, tend to show larger declines in trust compared to those from regions with shorter or less intense combat exposure. This regional variation underscores the importance of local context and the specific nature of wartime experiences in shaping long-term social outcomes. Economic and Institutional Context: The study also finds that the post-war economic and institutional context can moderate the effects of early combat exposure on trust. Regions that experienced rapid economic recovery and strong institutional development after the war show smaller declines in trust levels. This suggests that economic stability and effective governance can help mitigate the negative long-term effects of early-life exposure to violence, highlighting the role of post-conflict reconstruction and institutional quality in fostering social cohesion.

Psychological Resilience and Social Support:  Role of Social Networks: The presence and strength of social networks during and after the war play a critical role in moderating the impact of early combat exposure on trust. Individuals who had access to strong family and community support systems tend to show smaller declines in trust. These social networks can provide emotional support and a sense of stability, helping individuals cope with the trauma of war and maintain higher levels of trust in others. Hedonic Adaptation: The study explores the concept of hedonic adaptation, where individuals' trust levels may recover over time following initial declines due to early combat exposure. However, the findings suggest that while some degree of adaptation occurs, the long-term impact on trust remains significant, indicating that the early-life exposure to violence has enduring effects that are not fully offset by later life experiences.",N,N,N,N,In Process,No,Yes

The estimation strategy involves the following key components: Experimental Design: Random Assignment: The study employs randomized controlled experiments within the survey. Respondents were randomly assigned to different treatment conditions, ensuring that any observed differences in attitudes could be attributed to the experimental manipulations rather than pre-existing differences among respondents.
    Treatment Conditions:
        Framing of Wartime Experiences: Respondents were exposed to one of four primes that framed their wartime experiences differently:
            Family Suffering: Emphasizing the suffering and losses experienced by the respondent's family.
            Community Suffering: Highlighting the suffering and losses endured by the respondent's broader community.
            Community Sacrifice: Framing the losses as sacrifices made by the community for a greater cause.
            Original Motives: Prompting respondents to recall the original motivations for the uprising against the Assad regime.
        Identity of Peace Proposer: Respondents were also assigned to one of four conditions where the proposer of a ceasefire was varied:
            Commander of the Syrian Army
            Commander from the Syrian Opposition
            Civilian Non-Combatant (with no specific injury)
            Civilian Non-Combatant who has lost a limb during the war

3. Outcome Measures:

    Attitudes Towards Ceasefire and Peace Agreements: Respondents were asked about their level of agreement with statements supporting a ceasefire and a peace process proposed by the assigned actor.
    Willingness to Compromise: They were also asked about their willingness to accept a peace settlement that includes a role for the Assad regime versus demanding the regime’s full removal.

4. Data Analysis:

    Difference-in-Means Tests: The primary analytical method involved comparing the mean levels of agreement and willingness to compromise across the different treatment conditions. Because the treatments were randomly assigned, any significant differences in outcomes can be causally attributed to the treatment effects.
    Collapsing Categories: For some analyses, the researchers collapsed response categories to simplify interpretation. For example, responses indicating agreement or strong agreement with a ceasefire were combined into a single ""agree"" category, while responses indicating disagreement or strong disagreement were combined into a ""disagree"" category.
    Robustness Checks: The study included various robustness checks to ensure the validity of the findings. These checks involved comparing results across different framing conditions and different proposer identities to confirm that the observed effects were consistent and reliable.

5. Hypotheses Testing:

    Hypothesis 1a: Respondents are more likely to favor a ceasefire when proposed by a Syrian civilian compared to military elites from either the regime or the opposition.
    Hypothesis 1b: Even among respondents who identify closely with the opposition, support for a ceasefire is higher when proposed by a Syrian civilian compared to an opposition commander.
    Hypothesis 2a-2c: Willingness to settle with the regime varies depending on whether violence is framed as community sacrifice, community suffering, or family suffering, with suffering frames leading to higher willingness to compromise.
    Hypothesis 3: Among respondents from neighborhoods that have experienced violence, the effects of the framing primes on willingness to settle are examined to see if prior exposure to violence moderates these effects.
    Hypothesis 4: The study also explores whether framing violence as community sacrifice influences respondents' optimism about the likelihood of an opposition victory against the regime.",,,,,,,0,"None, focus is on individual-level analysis",1,"Demographic Characteristics:

    War Exposure: War exposure was measured using a 14-item checklist adapted from previous studies. The checklist assessed various war-related events that participants could have experienced, witnessed, or perpetrated. Each item was coded as 1 if the respondent had experienced it and 0 otherwise, and a sum score of war exposure was created.
    Mental Health: Mental health was measured using two instruments:
        Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI): This assessed general psychological distress through 18 items measuring anxiety, somatization, and depression on a 4-point scale.
        PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5): This measured posttraumatic stress symptoms using 20 items rated on a 5-point scale.
    Social Capital: Social capital was assessed using items reflecting general trust, collective action, civic engagement, and social support. These items were derived from the Integrated Social Capital Questionnaire and adapted for the study context. Analytical Framework:

    Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM): The primary analytical method used was GSEM, which allows for the simultaneous estimation of multiple paths, including binary, ordered logistic, Poisson, and linear paths. This approach is particularly suited for complex models involving both direct and indirect effects.
    Mediation Analysis: The central focus of the analysis was to examine the mediating role of mental health in the relationship between war exposure and social capital. The models estimated the direct effect of war exposure on social capital, the direct effect of war exposure on mental health, and the indirect effect of war exposure on social capital through mental health.
    Delta Method: The delta method was used to estimate the mediation effects within the GSEM framework. This method provides robust standard errors for indirect effects, enhancing the reliability of the mediation analysis.

4. Controls and Robustness Checks:

    Control Variables: Several control variables were included in the models to account for potential confounders. These included age, gender, education level, duration in the refugee camp, household size, and differences between the refugee camps.
    Model Fit and Robustness: The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was used to assess the fit of each model, with lower AIC values indicating better-fitting models. The study also conducted robustness checks by comparing models with different sets of control variables and using alternative measures of social capital and mental health.

5. Reverse Mediation Models:

    Exploration of Bidirectional Relationships: In addition to the primary mediation models, the study calculated reverse mediation models to explore the potential bidirectional relationship between mental health and social capital. This involved testing whether social capital could also mediate the relationship between war exposure and mental health, though the primary focus remained on the hypothesized direction.",,,,,,,1,refugee camp,1,"Age, Gender, Education level, Duration in the refugee camp, and household size",1,"Systematic sampling and random walk methods were used to select participants, aiming to reduce selection bias.",0,"None, migration bias was not specifically controlled in this study",0,"None, survival bias was not explicity addressed in this study",1,"The study finds that war exposure has an overall positive direct effect on social capital, but this effect is mediated by mental health problems, which negatively impact social capital.","Behavioral outcomes suggest that higher levels of war exposure are associated with increased community participation and social support, but these effects are weakened by the presence of mental health issues.",1,"The study identifies heterogeneous effects based on the type of mental health issue, with general psychological distress having a more consistent negative impact on social capital compared to PTSD symptoms.",N,N,N,N,In Process,,

The study suggests that enhancing these resilience factors could be an effective strategy for reducing behavioral problems in children living in conflict zones.,1,"The impact of political violence exposure on children's difficulties varies significantly between Jewish and Arab children. Among Jewish children, self-control is a significant moderator, meaning that children with higher levels of self-control experience fewer psychological difficulties in response to political violence compared to those with lower self-control.

For Arab children, self-esteem plays a more critical role. Higher levels of self-esteem are associated with fewer social and psychological difficulties among Arab children exposed to political violence. This indicates that self-esteem acts as a buffer, providing Arab children with a sense of self-worth and confidence that helps them cope better with the adverse effects of political violence. The study also highlights that these resilience factors do not operate in isolation. The interaction between self-control and self-esteem is particularly important for Arab children. Children with both high self-esteem and high self-control exhibit the least psychological difficulties, demonstrating the combined protective effect of these two factors.

The primary analysis focuses on the differential effects of Israeli military operations and the Gaza blockade on public opinion in the Gaza Strip compared to the West Bank.

Geographic Variation:
The study finds that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank exhibit different responses to Israeli policies. While support for militant factions remains high in Gaza, it decreases in the West Bank over time. This divergence suggests that the specific context and conditions in Gaza, including the intensity of the blockade and direct exposure to military operations, lead to different public opinion dynamics compared to the West Bank.

Intensity of Exposure:
The severity of exposure to Israeli military operations and the blockade significantly impacts public opinion. During periods of intense military activity, such as major operations (e.g., Operation Cast Lead), Gazan support for militant factions initially increases but may decrease in the short term. However, this effect is not sustained over the long term, indicating a transient impact. The study finds that higher fatalities in Gaza are strongly associated with increased support for militant factions, suggesting that more severe exposure leads to a more pronounced radicalization effect.

Timing of Exposure:
The timing of exposure to Israeli policies also influences public opinion. The study observes that the impact of military operations on Gazan support for militant factions is more significant during and immediately after the operations. For example, during Operation Cast Lead, support for militants increased significantly in Gaza compared to the West Bank. However, this effect dissipates relatively quickly, highlighting the short-lived nature of the attitudinal shifts. In contrast, the prolonged blockade of Gaza shows a weaker and less consistent association with changes in support for militant factions, indicating that the timing and nature of the intervention play crucial roles in shaping public opinion.

Policy-Specific Effects:
The analysis reveals that different Israeli policies have distinct impacts on Palestinian public opinion. While military operations tend to provoke short-term increases in support for militants, the blockade's effect is more ambiguous and less pronounced. The blockade does not consistently lead to significant changes in support for militant factions, suggesting that the economic and social hardships imposed by the blockade do not translate into clear shifts in political preferences. This finding challenges the assumption that economic pressure alone can effectively alter public opinion in favor of deterring support for militancy.",N,N,N,N,In Process,,

The study highlights that Jewish adolescents are more likely to report feeling unsafe, fearful, and emotionally disturbed by the political violence, which exacerbates their psychological challenges. In contrast, Arab adolescents, while also exposed to high levels of political violence, report a relatively lower perceived impact and fewer psychological difficulties compared to their Jewish counterparts. This difference may be influenced by several factors, including socio-cultural contexts, coping mechanisms, and the nature of their identification with the conflict. Arab adolescents may have developed different coping strategies or may perceive the political violence within a different socio-political framework that affects their subjective impact assessments. The study also finds that the nature of political violence exposure differs between the two groups. Jewish adolescents are more likely to experience direct threats and victimization from terrorist attacks, whereas Arab adolescents are more exposed to involvement in violent demonstrations and property destruction.

Additionally, the impact of family size on satisfaction is moderated by religiosity. For religious Jewish families, larger family sizes are associated with higher life satisfaction, whereas for secular Jewish families, larger families are linked to lower life satisfaction. This interaction suggests that the value placed on having children and the support systems available to religious families help mitigate the financial and emotional strains associated with larger families.

Municipal-level economic activity and institutional performance to capture broader environmental influences on public good provision. 3. Security conditions and rule of law to account for the impact of ongoing tensions and governance quality on cooperative behavior. These controls help to isolate the effects of minority status and victimization from other contextual factors that might influence public good contributions and interethnic trust.",1,"Individual-level controls include demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, and employment status. The models also account for the level of conflict victimization and out-group distrust, as well as interaction terms to explore how these factors interact with majority/minority status. These controls help ensure that the observed relationships are not confounded by other individual-level factors.",1,"The study acknowledges potential selection bias due to the stratified sampling method and the self-selection of participants into the experiment. However, the random assignment to treatment conditions (majority/minority status) and the inclusion of various demographic controls help to mitigate this bias. The researchers also conduct robustness checks to ensure the stability of their findings and address any remaining concerns about selection effects.",1,"Migration bias is addressed by including respondents from both urban and rural areas, as well as those who were displaced during the conflict. The analysis controls for current location to account for regional differences in public good contributions and ethnic trust. This approach helps ensure that the observed effects are not driven by migration patterns during or after the conflict.",1,"The study partially addresses survival bias by including controls for victimization and exposure to violence, recognizing that those who survived the conflict might have different characteristics compared to those who did not. The analysis considers the intensity of victimization and its effects on public good contributions, but it cannot fully account for the selective survival of individuals with specific traits.",1,"The study finds that minority status significantly impacts public good contributions, with individuals contributing less when they are part of an ethnic minority. Conflict victimization intensifies out-group distrust, leading to increased parochial bias and underinvestment in public goods among minority groups. Ethnic Serbs in Kosovo express greater concerns about security, political exclusion, and dissatisfaction with civil liberties and human rights protections compared to majority Albanians. These findings highlight the enduring impact of conflict on ethnic trust and cooperative behavior in post-conflict societies.","Behavioral outcomes indicate that minority groups are less likely to contribute to public goods and more likely to divest from common resources when in the minority. This pattern is consistent across both experimental and real-world settings, with Serbs in Kosovo showing lower political participation and willingness to pay taxes compared to Albanians. The study also finds that intergroup contact and institutional trust can mitigate these effects, promoting greater cooperation and trust between ethnic groups.",1,"The study identified significant heterogeneous effects based on majority/minority status and ethnic trust. Minority group members (Serbs) exhibited lower contributions to public goods compared to the majority group (Albanians), reflecting parochial biases. The interaction between victimization and minority status showed that victimization reduced public good contributions in the minority treatment but increased them in the majority treatment, indicating that conflict experiences exacerbated parochial biases. The study also found that intergroup contact and institutional trust were positively associated with ethnic trust, suggesting that these factors could mitigate the negative effects of minority status and victimization on public good provision. The heterogeneous effects highlight the need for targeted interventions to address the specific challenges faced by minority groups in post-conflict settings.",N,N,N,N,In Process,N,N

Veterans, particularly those with combat experience, are more likely to engage in diverse and intense forms of civic participation compared to non-veterans. The findings suggest that military service fosters a sense of civic responsibility and engagement, contributing to social capital formation.","Behavioral outcomes indicate that combat veterans are more likely to participate in veteran groups and other civic organizations compared to non-combat veterans and non-veterans. The study also finds that education enhances civic participation, but the positive association between military service and civic participation remains significant even after controlling for education.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on the type of military service and combat experience. Specifically, combat veterans exhibit higher levels of civic participation compared to non-combat veterans and non-veterans. This finding suggests that the intense experiences of combat foster stronger social bonds and a greater sense of civic responsibility, leading to higher engagement in community activities. The researchers propose that the socializing effects of combat—such as the necessity for teamwork, communication, and leadership under extreme conditions—contribute to the increased civic participation observed among combat veterans. These intense experiences may enhance veterans' civic capacity and predisposition, making them more likely to take on roles in veteran groups, service organizations, and fraternal organizations. Additionally, the study reveals that the positive effects of military service on civic participation are robust across different age cohorts and demographic groups. This suggests that the impact of military service on social capital and civic engagement is broad and enduring, affecting individuals from various backgrounds and stages of life. For instance, older veterans show sustained levels of civic engagement well into their later years, indicating the long-term influence of military service on civic behavior. The researchers also find that these effects are consistent across different demographic variables, including education, race, and socio-economic status. This highlights the universal nature of the civic benefits associated with military service and combat experience. The study's findings underscore the importance of understanding the diverse and complex ways in which military service shapes social and civic outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the specific contexts and experiences of veterans when examining their civic engagement.",N,N,N,N,In Process,N,N

Fearful individuals are less likely to engage in political discussions, attend community meetings, or vote, indicating a substantial negative impact of fear on democratic engagement.","The behavioral outcomes align with the attitudinal findings, showing that fear leads to lower levels of political participation. The study provides evidence that fear can paralyze political engagement, undermining democratic processes in conflict-affected regions.",1,"The study identifies significant heterogeneous effects based on individual characteristics and the type of exposure to violence. For instance, the negative impact of fear on political engagement is more pronounced among individuals with lower socio-economic status and those with higher subjective assessments of insecurity. This suggests that individuals who are already vulnerable or perceive their environment as highly insecure are more likely to withdraw from political activities when they experience fear. Additionally, the researchers find that the effects of fear vary by the type of violence exposure. Specifically, government bombings have a stronger impact on reducing political engagement compared to insurgent violence. This distinction indicates that the source of violence plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' political behaviors. The fear induced by state-led violence appears to have a more profound and demobilizing effect than fear caused by insurgent actions.",N,N,N,N,In Process,N,N
